title: New Documentation Site!
---

Surprise! We've unified our documentation process with [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)'s. The docs revamp addresses one of the biggest demands for BuckleScript.

A few highlights:

- The old doc site still exists at the [same location](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html), to preserve backward-compat for docs for a while.
- Internationalization is now here and works the same way as ReasonReact's. Go wild.
- The sections are now more cleanly organized.
- More docs, simpler sections, more examples, fewer typos, nicer styling.
- Reason code snippets alongside the OCaml snippets!

Enjoy and have a nice weekend!
