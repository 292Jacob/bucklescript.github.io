title: BuckleScript 1.5.0
---


Besides a number of minor bug fixes and perf improvement, most notable changes

- Bundled Reason together thanks to Reason team, so that Reason syntax support is also first class, this also makes Reason for the first time available to Windows users.
- FFI added [`bs.uncurry`](https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/function.html#extra-solution) which will automatically uncurry the callback so the user land API is clearer
- Improve [object label translation](https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/object.html#invalid-field-names) to cause less surprise, this might case minor backward compatibility
