title: BuckleScript 1.5.0
---


Besides a number of minor bug fixes and perf improvement, most notable changes

- Bundled Reason together thanks to Reason team, so that Reason syntax support is also first class, this also makes Reason for the first time available to Windows users.
- FFI added [`bs.uncurry`]((http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#__bs_uncurry_for_implicit_uncurried_callback_since_1_5_0)) which will automatically uncurry the callback so the user land API is clearer
- Improve [object label translation]((http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_object_label_translation_convention)) to cause less surprise, this might case minor backward compatibility
