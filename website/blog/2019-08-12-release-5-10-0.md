title: What's new in release 5.1.0 
---

`bs-platform` 5.1.0 (for OCaml 4.02.3) and 6.1.0 (for OCaml 4.06.1) is ready for testing.

You can install it via `npm i -g bs-platform@5.1.0-dev.6` (or `npm i -g bs-platform@6.1.0-dev.6`).

A detailed list of changes is available [here](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/blob/master/Changes.md#510)


Some feature enhancement is described as below:

## Introducing `bsc` to public 

`bsc` is the underlying compiler which invoked by `bsb`. In this release we simplified it a bit so that it can be used directly by customers for simple tasks, it is available after you have `bs-platform` installed.

Suppose you have a file called `test.re`
```
let rec fib (n) = switch n {
    | 0 | 1 => 1;
    | n => fib (n -1) + fib(n-2);
};

Js.log (fib (0));
```
You can compile it directly via `bsc test.re`
```
bucklescript.github.io>bsc test.re
// Generated by BUCKLESCRIPT, PLEASE EDIT WITH CARE
'use strict';


function fib(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return fib(n - 1 | 0) + fib(n - 2 | 0) | 0;
  }
}

console.log(fib(0));

exports.fib = fib;
/*  Not a pure module */
```
You can also get the inferred signature directly via `bsc -i test.re`
```
let fib: int => int;
```
Note `bsc` support vanilla ocaml syntax as well.

## `bstracing` to visualize build profile

After user finish the build process, user can run `bstracing` directly which generates a data file called `tracing_${hour}_${minute}_${second}.json ` which can be loaded into chrome via `chrome://tracing`.

Below is an profie image that shows the tracing graph for a large project

## Support of ppx with arguments

We extended the schema that ppx with arguments is supported

```js
        "ppx-specs": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "oneOf" : [
                    {
                        "type": "string" // single command
                    },
                    {
                        "type" : "array", // command with args
                        "items": {
                            "type" : "string" 
                        }
                    }
                ]

            }
        },
```

## Respect NODE_PATH when resolving dependent modules

Previosly, `bsb` is tied to npm package structures by searching `node_modules`, in this release, `bsb` also try to search paths listed in `NODE_PATH` so that `bsb` is no longer tied to npm or yarn package manager

## Build performance improvement

Yes, performance is increased by each release!
