title: BuckleScript 3.1

List of changes [here](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/blob/master/Changes.md#310)! Highlights:

## Print Record Keys and Variant Tags

A picture's worth a thousand words:

<table>
  <thead> <tr><th>Before</th><th>After</th></tr> </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="/img/debugger-before.png" alt="debugger before">
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: middle">
        <img src="/img/debugger-after.png" alt="debugger after">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Please see [Better Data Structures Printing (Debug Mode)](/docs/en/better-data-structures-printing-debug-mode.html) for usage.

## Even Better `bs.deriving abstract`

We've further polished our new way of binding to JS objects. The record fields of a `bs.deriving abstract` can now accept functions.

## Pipe First Improvement

[Pipe First](/docs/en/pipe-first.html) now supports piping into variant tags!

```ocaml
let result = name |. preprocess |. Some
```

```reason
let result = name |. preprocess |. Some
```

We turn this into:

```ocaml
let result = Some(preprocess(name))
```

```reason
let result = Some(preprocess(name))
```

## Js.Boolean Is Gone

Since BuckleScript 3.0, OCaml `bool` now compile to JS `boolean`. It was deprecated (all the boolean conversion functions became no-ops, with warnings during build), and now completely removed. No more need for the converter functions!
