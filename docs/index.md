BuckleScript is a backend for [OCaml](http://ocaml.org/) which emits
readable, modular and highly performant JavaScript.

\#\# Developer experience

BuckleScript probably has the *fastest* JavaScript compiler.The compiler
is compiled to both native code and JavaScript, users can try the
compiler in the
[browser](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript-playground) and
imagine how fast it would be for native backend.

\#\# Integration with existing JavaScript libraries

BuckleScript is one of the very few compilers which compiles an
*existing typed language* to readable JavaScript. It has the same
characteristics of typescript: one OCaml module compiled into one
JavaScript module (AMDJS, CommonJS, or Google module) without name
mangling.

\#\# Itâ€™s OCaml ! - 30 years distilled research in PL and amazing effort
of compiler engineering - Native backends: AMD64, IA32, PowerPC, ARM,
SPARC - Language based OS: Mirage Unikernel

\#\# Installation

    npm install -g bs-platform

\#\# Enjoy!
