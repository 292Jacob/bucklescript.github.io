title: Shared Primitives

BuckleScript's primitives such as `string`, `float`, `array` and a few others have a rather interesting property: they compile to the exact same thing in JavaScript. Thanks to this, there's close to no API to learn.

P.S. if you need an overview of the language primitives themselves, see [the Reason docs](https://reasonml.github.io/guide/language).

## String

Immutable on both sides, as expected.
